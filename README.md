# jobify

Project developed during the course Fullstack Master, of DevPleno (https://www.devpleno.com/).
 
Jobify is a simple job posting system where you can post, edit and delete jobs through a management area visible only on localhost, so that these changes can be made only through updates by Github.

Instructions: 
 
To start the application, you need Node.js installed on your machine. Then navigate to the Jobify folder through the terminal and use the command:
 
node index.js
 
Then, access the application in your browser at the localhost URL: 3000
